# Portfolio

- The goal for this repository is create a functional project using NeoVim and GitHub Copilot as main tools.
- Based in the idea exposed in <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tALribLN96A>

Technologies used:

- React (with Javascript)
- Vite
- Node
- Eslint
- Prettier
- Font Awesome
- i18n (For manage language support)
- emailjs

For publish the project in GitHub Pages, I used the next command (dist folder should be in the root of the project):

`git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages`
